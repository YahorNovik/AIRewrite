# Privacy Policy — AI Grammar Replace

_Last updated: 2025-09-24

**What the extension does**  
AI Grammar Replace rewrites only the text you explicitly select and invoke via a hotkey or context menu. It replaces the selected text in place on the page.

## Data We Process
- **Selected text** you choose to rewrite.
- **Non-identifying client ID** used to enforce daily limits and diagnose issues (no account required).

## How We Use Data
- The selected text is sent to our proxy backend solely to obtain a rewritten version from Google Generative Language (Gemini).
- We do not sell data, use it for advertising, or build user profiles.

## Storage & Retention
- We **do not persist** the content of your selected text on our servers.
- Short-lived technical logs (timestamps, status codes, latency, anonymized counters) may be kept for reliability and abuse prevention, then discarded.

## Third Parties
- **Google Generative Language API (Gemini)** is used to produce the rewritten text. Requests are sent over HTTPS.

## Security
- All communication is **HTTPS-only**.
- The backend can restrict access to the **published Chrome extension ID** and optionally verify signed requests.

## On-Page Access
- The content script is injected **on demand** only when you invoke the extension, and operates solely on your current selection.
- We do **not** read or transmit page content other than the text you explicitly select.

## Children’s Privacy
This extension is not directed to children under 13 and does not knowingly collect personal information from children.
